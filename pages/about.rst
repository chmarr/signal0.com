What's this blog about?
-----------------------

My guess right now is that this blog will be mostly about tech stuff.  Tips
I find or come up with will end up up here.  DevOps (I hate that term), Linux,
FreeBSD, Python, Django, MySQL, Cloud Computing... these are the things I deal
with the most often, so expect those here.

Who knows though - I could post about anything.  I'll just try to keep it
interesting, at least to me.

Where'd you get the site name?

Who are you?
------------

My name is Mike.  I work with computers and have been for a decent amount of
time.  I'm also crappy at filling out things like this, but I'll get to it
someday.
