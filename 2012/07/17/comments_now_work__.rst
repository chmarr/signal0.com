Comments now work!
==================

Thanks to Vlad Riscutia for putting out a hotpatch (and new release) of
Tinkerer_ that fixes the Disqus bug issue signal0 now has comments.  This may
actually end up being a bad thing, but I still want to thank Vlad for being
so responsive on this awesome piece of code!
