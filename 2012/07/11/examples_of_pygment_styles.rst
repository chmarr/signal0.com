examples of pygment styles
==========================

So in `this blog post`_ I talked about how you'd have to test each of the
pygments styles for yourself.  Well, turns out that's just not true, thanks to
Favio Manriquez Leon over at http://favrik.com/.  He posted a cool page with
an example of all the built in pygments styles at
http://blog.favrik.com/2011/02/22/preview-all-pygments-styles-for-your-code-highlighting-needs/

Enjoy!
