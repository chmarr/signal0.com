Introducing NYMMS
=================

I haven't posted for a while (5 months, ugh), but that doesn't mean I've been
idle this whole time.  I've been working on a new monitoring system, and I
think it's at the point where I want to share it with the world.  It can do
the basics - monitor services and send alerts when they fail.  I'd love it if
other people started to play with it so I can get some feedback/bugs.

Anyway, check it out:

- `NYMMS docs`_
- `NYMMS github`_

Also, be sure to checkout the `Demo AMI`_ page if you want to bring up an
all-in-one NYMMS system with very basic configuration to play with.
