shortcut your email on iOS
==========================

Ok, this is probably something people have already thought to do, but I only
today figured it out.  What's screwed up is that I already knew about the
shortcut feature in iOS (I hated the fact it defaulted 'omw' to 'On my way!').

Basically I end up having to type my email address fairly often, and typing
email addresses on the iPhone isn't the easiest.  Soooo, today I setup a couple
of shortcuts.  You can set these up by going into **Settings > General >**
**Keyboard** and then clicking on **Add New Shortcut**.

I setup the following shortcuts:

**@@**
    *My personal email address*

**@w**
    *My work email address*

**@p**
    *My phone number*

Now I can just type those whenever I need to give my email address.

I'm trying to think of other shortcuts - if you have any ideas, share them in
the comments!
