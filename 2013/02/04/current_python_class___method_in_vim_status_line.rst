current python class & method in vim status line
================================================

I've been looking through some (awesome) third party modules lately, and while
doing so I kept running into the same issue fairly often.  Whenever I was
looking at a module that had large classes (spanning multiple screens) I would
find myself getting lost.  For the longest time I've just sucked it up, but
today I decided there has to be a better way!  Enter the `Python Helper`_ vim
plugin.

.. _`Python Helper`: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=435

After downloading that module and dropping it into my *.vim/plugin/* directory
now whenever I'm in a python file it does this for me:

Sooo much easier, and now I can save some of the precious few brain cells I
have for other things.
