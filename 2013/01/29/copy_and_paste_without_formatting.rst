copy and paste without formatting
=================================

So one thing that's been annoying me more and more lately is that when you
copy and paste text from a style-aware (say Chrome) app to another
style-aware (say Mail.app) app in Mac OS X that it copies the style.  There are
shortcuts you can use to paste without style, but in Mail.app the shortcut is
Shift-Option-Command-V (which doesn't seem like all that much of a shortcut to
my fingers).

Anyway, I went hunting for how to fix this and I found a way.  `Here it is.`_

The CLI version didn't work for me, but the System Preferences route worked
like a charm.
