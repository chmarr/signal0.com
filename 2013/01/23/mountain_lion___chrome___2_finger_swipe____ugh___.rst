Mountain Lion + Chrome + 2 Finger Swipe == ugh...
=================================================

I'm not sure when it started happening, but recently I've noticed that when
using the 2-finger-swipe to scroll left & right in chrome it sometimes instead
choses to interpret that gesture as me wanting to either go back or forward
in my browser history.  Talk about annoying.  Fortunately you can disable this,
but rather than doing it in Chrome you have to do it
*System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures*.  The first option is
'Swipe between pages'.  Uncheck that and things go back to *normal*.
